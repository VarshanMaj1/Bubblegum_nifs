# BubblegumNif

**TODO:  Native Implemented Functions (NIFs) that bridge the Metaplex mpl-bubblegum Rust crate (github.com/metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum/tree/main/clients/rust) to Elixir, enabling Elixir developers to construct and send compressed NFT transactions on Solana.**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
